[Platform Cooperativism](https://platform.coop/about), addresses the "gig economy" or the "sharing economy" represented by companies like Uber, GrubHub, and AirBnB, in which "workers are reclassified as independent contractors and thus denied rights such as minimum wage protections, unemployment benefits, and collective bargaining." Platform Cooperativism advances alternative platforms that are worker-owned.

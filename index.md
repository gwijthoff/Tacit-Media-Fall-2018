Description
============


<!--
The luddites, the philosophers, even the tech evangelists all seem to be in agreement that living in a digitally networked world has changed something about the way we understand ourselves as both individuals and members of a public. In a moment when digital media are complicating some of our foundational assumptions about everything from democratic consensus to the nature of privacy, we need to take stock of the kinds of humanistic research that can put these developments into perspective.

This seminar will require flexibility in your reading: we will be moving from French poststructuralism to digital media theory to popular writing.

Aim of the course for me personally: to be able to articulate why media theory matters in the public sphere

We'll move from more classic media theory concerns (apparatus, technological determinism) with updates on how those terms are evolving now, and then we'll proceed into more emerging areas of research (habit, algorithms, privacy).
-->

This seminar will introduce a range of frameworks useful for thinking through the history, politics, ethics, and aesthetics of digital media. Units on emerging approaches to contemporary digital infrastructures (questions of selfhood, privacy, algorithms and inequality) will be paired with an overview of the most influential paradigms in media studies. In what ways do canonical media theories, keyed to the analysis of older media (cinema, radio), address contemporary issues in digital culture and politics?

Concepts from our readings will be operationalized with weekly exercises that include tactics for or protecting personal data, blocking unwarranted surveillance, and leaving filter bubbles. Students will leave with the basic computational literacy necessary for informed scholarship that both critiques and utilizes digital media.

Guiding us through these wide-ranging subjects will be a structuring theme: "tacit media," or the background, habitual operation of our networked devices that we take for granted and that take us for granted in turn. How can boredom, distraction, and habit‚Äì‚Äìonce celebrated by media theorists as "embodied intelligence" (Susan Sontag) and "tactile appropriation" (Walter Benjamin)‚Äì‚Äìcontinue to be tactical modes of engagement in our current media and political environment?

Workshop Series
======================

## Data Privacy, Democracy, and The Humanities

As part of our seminar, we will lead three workshops open to the undergraduate community on privacy, surveillance, and social media practices. Each workshop will pair hands-on exercises using students‚Äô own devices with concepts from our seminar readings. Undergrads will be given new perspectives on and tactics for issues that are vital to the health of the networked public sphere today.

Each event will involve 1) a brief presentation on the issue, 2) a visiting technologist from the Philadelphia area, and 3) a hands-on lesson. Together, we will determine together the way to best teach the importance of each issue to our undergraduate students.

<!--
Issues from smartphone addiction to fake news have computer science programs around the country looking for ways to teach ethics and politics. I would like these workshops to examine what the humanities instead offers fraught conversations on digital culture today.

## even weeks: digital media theory

Even-numbered weeks will be devoted to recent scholarship on digital media and culture, with an emphasis on emerging approaches to questions of selfhood (privacy, habit, boredom, intimacy), inequality (biased algorithms, digital divides, information illiteracy), and the public (bots, fake news, filter bubbles, revolution). Altogether, these weeks will provide students with a sense of the "stack" of technologies and policies making up the networked world, from code to interface to device to infrastructure to power.

## odd weeks: paradigms of media studies

Odd-numbered weeks will be devoted to influential concepts from the history of media studies, including theories of cinema spectatorship, technics, and broadcast media that take on new value in understanding and negotiating the ways we live with technology today. Special emphasis will be given to visual media. While the boundaries of media studies are porous, as much as possible we will try to isolate the dominant paradigms.


## exercises and tactics

These exercises, to be paired with particular readings, will introduce everyday tactics for, among other things, regaining authorship over the portraits of our lives being assembled by data brokers, and protecting against surveillance by government agencies who actively monitor the search results and social media activity of immigrants and citizens who speak with immigrants.

- Conduct self-surveillance using browser plugins like Data Selfie [shutdown notice](https://dataselfie.it/#/shutdown), ProPublica's "What Facebook Thinks You Like," and Cambridge's "Apply Magic Sauce" in order to see (and alter) how Facebook creates your psychological profile.
- read *Public By Default* Venmo stories from public Venmo data <https://publicbydefault.fyi/>
- Using an arbitrarily selected calendar date that the class will agree on as a group (i.e. Wednesday, March 9, 2016), reconstruct a narrative of that day based on traces you have willingly left behind: emails, Facebook likes, activity trackers, etc. We will assemble a portrait of this day using only our digitally-distributed memories.
- Request your data profiles from Facebook and Twitter using PersonalData.io, and from data brokers using Acxiom's "Consumer Data Information" form.
- conduct a close reading of the privacy policy on three websites, online stores, or services you have used recently (overstock, comcast, etc)
- technique: record a video of yourself making coffee/tea, or something else you do/make every day. 60 sec max. Compare techniques in class.
